# TheMouse
A virtual pet written in C#

## A Bad Pet
Every turn its happiness goes down unless you juggle feeding and playing and cleaning it. You can adjust difficulty using:
    if (pFull < 5)
            {
                //if hungry, make unhappy quicker
                pHappy--;
            } //end if
            
Make it < 3 to make it easy, make it < 7 to make it impossible.

## A Very Short Game
Made to explore methods and classes.
